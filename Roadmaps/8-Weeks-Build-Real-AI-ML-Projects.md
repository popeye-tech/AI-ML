## 8 Weeks to Build Real AI/ML Projects and Speak About Them Confidently

Most learning roadmaps are either too shallow or too scattered. This one focuses on what to study, what to build, and how to think like an AI/ML practitioner‚Äîthrough real projects, essential skills, and reflection prompts to track progress.

#### How to Use This Tracker
An 8-week, self-paced system. Each week includes:
- A clear focus
- A real-world project
- Core tools to learn
- Reflection questions to deepen understanding

Adjust the pace to fit your schedule and modify projects to align with your goals. Consistency and depth matter most.

### üìÖ WEEK 1: Python, Pandas, and NumPy
Build fluency in working with data: loading datasets, cleaning, transforming, and spotting patterns. The goal is confidence in approaching any new dataset and knowing the next steps.

- Project: Analyze a music dataset to explore trends over decades (genre shifts, features of popular tracks, changes in energy/danceability by year).
- Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn or Matplotlib
- Reflection:
  - What parts of your workflow still feel slow?
  - Which tools or functions became easier with repetition?
  - If given a different dataset, which steps would you feel confident handling?

---

### üìÖ WEEK 2: Intro to Machine Learning
Train your first model and learn the supervised learning flow: splitting data, training multiple models, and comparing them with proper metrics.

- Project: Predict loan default using a structured dataset. Train several models, compare performance, and document behaviors and mistakes.
- Tools: Scikit-learn, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, metrics (precision, recall, ROC AUC)
- Reflection:
  - Which evaluation metric did you choose and why?
  - What surprised you about model performance?
  - How would you explain the model to a non-technical audience?

---

### üìÖ WEEK 3: Structured ML Projects and Messy Data
Work with real-world messiness: missing values, inconsistent formats, and edge cases. Focus on feature engineering, selection, and building ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù models with sound judgment.

- Project: Predict hospital readmissions. Handle class imbalance, identify key patient features, and explain predictions appropriately for a high-stakes context.
- Tools: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP or feature importance tools
- Reflection:
  - What trade-offs did you make in cleaning and feature selection?
  - How did you interpret the model‚Äôs decisions?
  - What would you change in a version two?

---

### üìÖ WEEK 4: End-to-End ML with Deployment
Ship something usable. Wrap your model into a simple app, design clean data flow, and present results with explanations.

- Project: Build a salary prediction tool for job listings (title, location, skills ‚Üí salary range) with visualized feature contributions.
- Tools: Streamlit or Gradio, SHAP for interpretability
- Reflection:
  - What assumptions did you make in your deployment pipeline?
  - What would you change to reach a broader audience?
  - Did deploying the model clarify your understanding?

---

### üìÖ WEEK 5: GenAI Foundations
Learn how large language models work, how to use APIs, and how to craft reliable prompts. Explore embeddings and vector search for retrieval-augmented applications.

- Project: Create a research paper assistant that ingests documents, embeds them, and enables LLM-assisted search and Q&A.
- Tools: LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI/Cohere), FAISS or Chroma, Python for orchestration
- Reflection:
  - What strategies improved your prompts?
  - What broke when retrieving and summarizing content?
  - How would you improve relevance and stability?

---

### üìÖ WEEK 6: Real GenAI Applications
Build a practical tool that solves a real problem, chaining prompts, functions, and retrieval with a smooth user experience.

- Project: Resume skill matcher‚Äîupload a resume and target job, return missing skills, learning resources, and job fit analysis.
- Tools: LangChain or custom chaining, LLM APIs, resume parsing libraries, optional Streamlit UI
- Reflection:
  - What made the tool genuinely useful (or not)?
  - How did you handle unexpected inputs?
  - What did you learn about LLM limitations?

---

### üìÖ WEEK 7: Agent Workflows and Tool Use
Move beyond single prompts. Implement agents that reason, use tools, and plan steps based on intermediate results. Focus on orchestration, tool APIs, and memory.

- Project: Meeting assistant that reads calendar data and notes, generates action items, follows up on tasks, and helps plan the next meeting‚Äîhandling context and failures gracefully.
- Tools: LangGraph or crewAI, function calling/assistants, scheduling/calendar APIs
- Reflection:
  - How did you balance automation with control?
  - Where did the agent struggle in multi-step flows?
  - Which parts of the workflow felt fragile?

---

### üìÖ WEEK 8: Capstone ‚Äî ML, GenAI, and Agents Together
Combine classic ML, LLM reasoning, and agent orchestration into a cohesive system. Demonstrate end-to-end planning, building, testing, and explanation.

- Project: Smart career advisor‚Äîgiven a resume and target role, suggest matching jobs, identify missing skills, estimate salary (reuse your ML model), and clearly explain suggestions with an LLM. Integrate structured data, prompts, and agent logic with a clean UI.
- Tools: Your choice (e.g., scikit-learn, LLM APIs, lightweight agent framework, simple UI)
- Reflection:
  - Which part of the system are you most proud of?
  - What gaps remain to be filled?
  - How would you walk through this project in an interview?
